#### This Tic-Tac-Toe game has been created using the powerful Minimax/MinMax algorithm. This game can be played against an AI agent or with another human player, providing an engaging and challenging experience.

## How Does It Work?
#### The Minimax algorithm is a decision-making algorithm used in two-player games, such as Tic Tac Toe, to determine the optimal move for a player. It evaluates all possible moves and their outcomes, assigning a score to each move based on the game's current state. The algorithm assumes that both players play optimally, aiming to maximize their chances of winning or minimize their chances of losing.

#### In this implementation, the AI agent utilizes the Minimax algorithm to make its moves. It intelligently analyzes the game board and predicts the most strategic move to make, considering both its own moves and the opponent's potential moves. By using this algorithm, the AI agent can make informed decisions that maximize its chances of winning or forcing a draw.

#### Whether you choose to challenge the AI agent or compete against a fellow human player, this Tic Tac Toe game offers an entertaining and intellectually stimulating experience.
